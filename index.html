                <p>Narrative visualization otherwise known as data-stoytelling, is an important communication medium that is used to spread information such as COVID-19 advice.
                Audience is not given enough thought when developing narrative visualization, which is problematic, especially when it is used to convey important information.
                </p>
                <p> In this work I study one element of narrative visualization to find out how it can be better used for a specific audience. I have chosen annotations because they are very important when explaining information to readers and vary greatly between narrative visualization. For the purposes of this work, annotations are any text that explains information in a narrative visualization.

                        <li class="li-table">Font choice is crucial in resonating towards a specific audience.

                        <li class="li-table">High contrast also contributes to the visual aesthetics of annotations. By employing a visually engaging and pleasing colour scheme, the overall aesthetic appeal of the content is increased, thereby making a more immersive and enjoyable experience.
                        <li class="li-table">An additional factor is that colour schemes depend on the target demographic, for example, lower contrast schemes such as blue and yellow may appear acceptable when targeting a younger audience. It is therefore important to consider the context in determining the most appropriate colour palette.</li>

                        <li class="li-table">Usage of transitions and animations has the potential to increase engagemenet and interest when targeting specific demographics. When applied appropriately to a younger audience, dynamic visual elements capture greater attention, thereby contributing towards a more engaging and captivating experience.</li>
                        <li class="li-table">Transitions and animations serve as effective tools to guide the user's focus from the data to the annotation.

                        <li class="li-table">Inclusion of universal and consistent icons serve as a powerful means to enhance visual communication as icons provide a secondary visual language that offers additional content and associations towards specific ideas.</li>

In doing so, it not only directs the users attention, but also aids in maintaining an organised narrative visualisation.</li>
